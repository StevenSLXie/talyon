## ðŸŽ¨ UI Revamp (Priority: High)
âœ… 1. **UI Design Overhaul**: Implement classic minimalist black/white design
   - Remove unnecessary clutter and visual noise
   - Ensure mobile-friendly responsive design
   - Apply consistent typography and spacing
   - Implement clean, professional aesthetic

## ðŸ“‹ Job Description Completeness (Priority: Medium)
âœ… 2. **Job Description Audit**: Check and fix incomplete job descriptions
   - Audit current job descriptions in database
   - Identify missing or incomplete descriptions
   - If data exists in DB: insert missing descriptions
   - If data missing: add scraping pipeline improvements
   - Ensure all jobs have complete, readable descriptions

## ðŸ¤– Advanced Job Recommendation System (Priority: High)
âœ… 3. **Two-Stage Job Recommendation**: Implement coarse + fine ranking system
   
   **Stage 1: Coarse Ranking (Rules-based)**
   - Use current job matching logic as initial filter
   - Generate list of top 20 candidate jobs
   - Apply hard filters and basic scoring
   
   **Stage 2: Fine Ranking (LLM-powered)**
   - Single LLM call: resume + 20 jobs analysis
   - For each job, generate:
     - Final matching score (0-100)
     - Detailed matching reasons
     - Non-matching points explanation
     - 2-3 key job highlights
     - Personalized analysis based on candidate's specific resume
   - Natural, advisor-like language (non-template)
   - Rank and display final recommendations
   - Highlight why each job is good/bad for THIS specific candidate

âœ… 1. read through the newsletter-app and understand what it does
âœ… 2. for current landing pages, keep the email login using resend
âœ… 3. delete all newsletter signup
âœ… 4. change to allow each user to upload their pdf/docx resume 
âœ… 5. we parse the resume and send it to LLM
âœ… 6. for LLM it does the folowing 
âœ… 7. analyze the resume and list candidate's stregth and weakless (dtailed prompt we can improve later, just have a first version)
âœ… 8. analyze the candidate's suitable salary range
âœ… 9. do tagging on the candidate in order to profile them (e.g., what skills they have, what company they have stayed)
âœ… 10. use the candaiate profile to match with job profile (you can have some very initial ideas on how to match). we can improve on it later
âœ… 11. you can use the output/consolidated_jobs_20250921_205754.json as sample data. (write them into database first)
âœ… 12. eventually, recommenda them a list of 3 jobs
âœ… 13. the whole idea of UI is that "why sending your same resume to 100 companies; we get you targeted blalalala"

## ðŸ”§ Critical Bug Fixes & Pipeline Improvements (Oct 1, 2025)

âœ… 14. **Fixed Critical Job Parsing Bug**: Company names, job titles, and locations were being assigned in wrong order
   - Root cause: Field assignment logic was incorrect in `parse_job_text()` method
   - Solution: Corrected field order - company (line 1), title (line 2), location (line 3)
   - Result: Database now contains accurately parsed job data

âœ… 15. **Implemented Batch LLM Processing**: Replaced sequential LLM calls with parallel async processing
   - Before: Sequential calls with 0.5s delays between jobs
   - After: Parallel batch processing using `asyncio.gather()` and thread pool execution
   - Improvement: Significantly faster LLM processing for large job batches

âœ… 16. **Enhanced Parsing Logic**: Improved job data extraction with better filtering
   - Added proper handling of job separators (`=== JOB X ===`)
   - Implemented smart filtering for response time indicators
   - Enhanced location pattern matching for Singapore regions
   - Improved salary parsing to avoid false positives

âœ… 17. **Database Pipeline Re-run**: Successfully cleared and re-processed all job data
   - Cleared existing incorrect data from database
   - Re-scraped 1,052 jobs from MyCareersFuture
   - Successfully processed 513 jobs (48.8% success rate)
   - 100% success rate for database storage of processed jobs

âœ… 18. **Pipeline Performance Metrics**:
   - Raw Jobs Scraped: 1,052
   - Jobs Refined: 513
   - Jobs Consolidated: 513  
   - Jobs Enhanced: 513
   - Jobs Stored in DB: 513
   - Failed Jobs: 0
   - Success Rate: 48.8% (for scraped jobs), 100% (for processed jobs)

âœ… 19. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Implemented robust exception handling for LLM calls
   - Enhanced job data validation and filtering
   - Improved database transaction handling

âœ… 20. **Git Commit**: Successfully committed all changes with detailed commit message

## ðŸ”§ Enhanced Profile Flow & Bug Fixes (Oct 30, 2025)

âœ… 25. **Fixed Enhanced Profile Flow**: Resolved critical issues with Stage 2 LLM analysis

âœ… 27. **Enhanced Profile Data Flow**: Improved LLM analysis with full candidate data
   - LLM now receives complete enhanced profile with all education details (PhD, Bachelor's, etc.)
   - Fixed education recognition in LLM prompts
   - Improved candidate profile accuracy for meaningful analysis
   - Enhanced profile construction from database with proper null handling
