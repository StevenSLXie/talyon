Glassdoor? ‚ùå **Overrated.** Most other review platforms? Same story.

If you really want to understand a local company ‚Äî or a big firm with strong local presence ‚Äî you need to dig into those old-school Web1.0 forums. Hidden in those threads are the real, unfiltered experiences that employees share.

Now, with AI, we can extract and summarize those voices. Even though forums feel like relics, the posts here are fresh ‚Äî all from the last 2 years. And surprisingly, these communities are still active after all this time.
