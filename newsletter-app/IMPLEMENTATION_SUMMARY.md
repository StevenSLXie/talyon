## ðŸŽ¯ Core Value Proposition

**"Why send your same resume to 100 companies? Get targeted matches instead."**

The platform transforms the job search from a numbers game to a targeted approach:
- Upload once, get analyzed
- Receive personalized recommendations
- Focus on quality matches, not quantity
- Save time and increase success rates

This implementation provides a solid foundation for Talyon, a resume-based job matching platform that delivers on the core promise of targeted job recommendations.
